# Procedure
## Acquiring Data
1. Acquire data 
- Some data provided (Data.Log10LifetimeRisk.Log10TotaStemCellDivisions.txt) from https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6535/1245?utm_campaign=toc_sci-mag_2021-03-18&et_rid=681382821&et_cid=3704890

## Data Analyses
1. Import data into a dataset
2. Drop NaN values from datset
3. Plot data in scatterplot
4. Perform linear regression
5. Plot lifetime risk in a histogram
6. Plot stem cell divisions in a histogram
7. Plot non-log transformed values in a histogram

## Hypothesis: The lifetime risk of cancer is directly and linearily correlated with the lifetime total stem cell divisions within a type of tissue.
	In order to determine whether the null hypothesis must be removed, a correlation test was used. The correlation coefficient was found to be about 0.836, and the p-value was found to be about 6.638e-7.
